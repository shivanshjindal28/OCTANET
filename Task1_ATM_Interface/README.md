The ATMs in our cities are built on Python, as we have all seen them. 
This project is a console-based python GUI (using tkinter) application with five different classes. In order to use the system, the user must enter his or her user ID and pin when it starts. Once the details are entered successfully, ATM functionality is unlocked. As a result of the project, the following operations can be performed:
1) Transactions History
2) Withdraw
3) Deposit
4) Transfer
5) Quit
In the provided code, two users are pre-defined in the system with their user IDs and PINs. Here are the details:

User 1:

User ID: user1
PIN: 1234
Balance: 1000
User 2:

User ID: user2
PIN: 5678
Balance: 500
When you run the application, you can use these credentials to log in and test the functionalities.
